        <h1>Molly McCafferty</h1>

        <h2>She/Her</h2>

        <p>I am 19 years old and a <strong>BFA Graphic Design student</strong> here at <em><strong>Illinois State University!</strong></em> I have lived in Northern IL for 8 years, and lived in the Bay Area of California for 11 years. I like comic books and Minecraft, and critiquing billboard fonts in the car with my parents <em>who can't escape the conversation</em> >:)</p>

        <p><h3>Favorite Animal</h3>
        <p>Cheetahs! One of the most unique large felines in the animal kingdom!</p>

        <p><h3>Favorite Food</h3></p>
        <p>Chicken, it's so versatile and one of the only meats I'll eat, which also means I eat it for almost every meal, oops.</p>

        <p><h3>Favorite Candy</h3></p>
        <p>MnM's, the mini ones! But they're difficult to pick up one by one after you spill them on a couch (may or may not know from experience).</p>

        <p><h3>Navigation</h3></p>
        <p>I am ignoring this!
